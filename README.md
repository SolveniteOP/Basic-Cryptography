# Cryptography Encoder/Decoder Project

A Python project that provides simple encoding and decoding functionalities for various formats including **Base64**, **Hex**, **Hexdump**, **Base85**, **Binary**, and **ROT13**. This tool allows users to input text and transform it using these encoding schemes, making it useful for beginners learning about cryptographic transformations.

## Features

- **Base64** encoding and decoding
- **Hex** encoding and decoding
- **Hexdump** encoding and decoding
- **Base85** encoding and decoding
- **Binary** encoding and decoding
- **ROT13** encoding and decoding

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SolveniteOPcryptography-encoder-decoder.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd cryptography-encoder-decoder

3. Run the Python script:

python Cryptography.py

4. Choose an encoding/decoding option from the list and input the data you want to transform.

# Sample Output
When you run the script, you'll see a menu like this:

Cryptography Encoder/Decoder:
1. Base64
2. Hex
3. Base85
4. Binary
5. ROT13
6. Hexdump
7. Exit

Select an option (1-7):
After selecting an option and entering your text, the program will output both the encoded and decoded versions of the data.

Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.x to run. You can download Python from the official website.

## Example
Example of Base64 encoding/decoding:

Enter the data: HelloWorld
Base64 Encoded: SGVsbG9Xb3JsZA==
Base64 Decoded: HelloWorld
